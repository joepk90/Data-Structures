/**
 * 
 * Hash Tables
 * 
 * Every language has a built in hash table
 * Javascript: Objects
 * Ruby: Hashes
 * Python: Dictionaries
 * Java: Maps
 * 
 * 
 * Usually assume a time complecity of O(1)
 * 
 *  * Hash Table Operations - Big O
 * - Lookup: O(1)
 * - Push/Append: O(1)
 * - Insert: O(1)
 * - Delete: O(1) 
 * 
 * Negatives:
 * - Operations occasions become O(n) due to collisions in memory
 * - (it's actually O(n) devided by size of elements in menory: O(n/elements)
 * 
 * Collision Resolutions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
